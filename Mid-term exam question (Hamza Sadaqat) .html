<h1> HISTORY</h1><br>
<b>Pakistan</b> is <i>predominantly</i> an <u>agricultural country.</u> <br>
However, since its independence in 1947, emphasis has been on irrigated agriculture, while the dryland/arid agriculture remained neglected.<br> 
With rapid increase in population the irrigated areas failed to provide food requirements and it became imperative to find out ways to make use of the huge part of culturable land in the rainfed region.  <b>In the 1970s</b>, the Government of Paksitan constituted a Barani Commision to review and recemmend measures for the development of rainfed agriculture and uplift of the poor masses through education, research and development of technology and manpower. <br>
